???
The easiest way to search and query spatial data in a GIS.
Selecting features highlight those attributes of interest, both on the screen and in the attribute table, for subsequent display and analysis.
Different approaches can be used:
Selection tools
Query by attribute(s)
Query by geography

.pull-left[
.large[
- This often used spatial query technique selects all features in the target layer that share a common locale with the source layer.

### Spatial Query – Completely Contain

.large[

### Spatial Query – Are Completely Within

### Spatial Query – Are Identical To

.large[
+ This spatial query returns features that have the exact same geographic location.  
+ It can be used on points, lines, or polygons, but the target layer type must be the same as the source layer type.]

### Spatial Query – Are Crossed By the Outline Of

.pull-left[
.large[

+ It allows for line or polygon layers to be used as both source and target layers.
]]

.pull-right[

### Spatial Query - Contain

.pull-left[
.large[
+ This method is similar to the COMPLETELY CONTAIN spatial query; however, features in the target layer will be selected even if the boundaries overlap.
+ It allows for point, line, or polygon features in the target layer when points are used as a source; when line and polygon target layers with a line source; and when only polygon target layers with a polygon source.

## Proximity Analysis: Finding what's nearby

.pull-left[
.large[
+ One of the most powerful operations of a GIS.
+ Many important questions hinge on proximity, the distance between features of interest.
    + How closed are secondary schools to alcohol and tobacco stores?
    + What neighbourhood are far from NTUC Fairprice?
    + Which buildings will be affected by the construction of Thomson-East Coast Line?
]]

--
.pull-right[
.large[
+ Based on the concept of proximity, **buffering** creates two areas: one area that is within a specified distance of selected features and the other area that is beyond.
+ The area that is within the specified distance is called **buffer zone**.
+ Features for buffering may be points, lines, or areas.
]]

### What is Topological Overlay?

.large[
+ A topology overlay operation combines the geometries and attributes of two feature layers to create the output.
+ All overlays require two layers: a GIS data layer that may contain polygons, lines and points and an overlay layer that must contain **polygons**.
  + The polygons in the overlay drawing guide the operation of the chosen overlay function to create a new, result layer. 
+ Feature layers to be overlaid must be **spatially registered** and based on the **same coordinate system**.

### Point-in-polygon Overlay

+ Overlay point objects on areas, compute **is contained in** relationship. 
+ Result is a new attribute for each point

### Line-in-polygon Overlay

.pull-left[
.large[
+ Overlay line objects on polygon objects, compute **is contained in** relationship. 
+ Lines are broken at each polygon object boundary 
+ Number of output lines is greater than number of input lines. 
+ Containing polygon is new attribute of each output line. 
]]

.pull-right[
![:scale 60%](img/image8b.jpg)
]

---
### Polygon-on-polygon Overlay

.pull-left[
.large[
+ Overlay two layers of polygon objects. 
+ Boundaries are broken at each intersection. 
+ Number of output polygons likely greater than the total number of input polygons. 
+ After overlay we can recreate either of the input layers by dissolving and merging based on the attributes contributed by the input layer.
]]

.pull-right[
![:scale 60%](img/image8d.jpg)
]

---
### Polygon-on-polygon Overlay: Union

.pull-left[
.large[
+ Union preserves all features from the inputs.
+ The boundary extent of the output combines the boundary extents of both input layers.
+ Union requires that both input layers be polygon layers.
]]

.pull-right[
![:scale 60%](img/image8e.jpg)
]

### Polygon-on-polygon Overlay: Intersect

.pull-left[
.large[
+ Intersect preserves only those features that fall within the area extent common to the inputs. 
+ The input layers may contain different features types. ]]

.pull-right[
![:scale 60%](img/image8f.jpg)
]

---
### Polygon-on-polygon Overlay: Identity

.pull-left[
.large[
+ Identity preserves only features that fall within the boundary extent of the layer defined as the **input** layer.
+ The other layer is called **identity** layer.
+ The input layer may contain points, lines, or polygon, and the identity layer is a **polygon** layer.

### Issue of Topological Overlay: Slivers

.center[
![:scale 75%](img/image8h.jpg)
]



???
During polygon overlay, many new and smaller polygons are created, some of which may not represent true spatial variations.  
The small, invalid polygons are called spurious or sliver polygons and can be a major problem in polygon overlay.
Most GIS packages incorporate some kind of tolerance in overlay operations to remove slivers. 

---
### Issue of Topological Overlay: Error Propagation

.large[
+ **Error propagation** refers to the generation of errors that are due to the inaccuracies of the input layers.
+ **Sliver** are examples of errors in the inputs that can propagate to the analysis output.
+ Error propagation in overlay usually involves two types of error: positional and identification.
  + **Positional errors** can be caused by the inaccuracies of boundaries that are due to digitizing or interpretation errors.
  + **Identification errors** can be caused by the inaccuracies of attribute data such as inaccurate coding of polygon values.

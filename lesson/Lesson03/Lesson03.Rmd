### Why should we worry about?

### What to represent?

.large[
The world is infinitely complex, but computer systems are finite.  
- Representations must somehow limit the amount of details captured.

###  How to represent? 

+ A MRT station can be represented by a point feature or a polygon feature.

###  How to capture multiple contexts? 

+ Geographical data link place, time, and attribute.

### Accuracy and Precision 

.pull-left[
+ Accuracy  can be defined as the degree or closeness to which the information on a map matches the values in the real world.
    + In GIS data, accuracy can be referred to a geographic position, but it can be referred also to attribute, or conceptual accuracy .
+ Precision refers how exact is the description of data.
    + Precise data may be inaccurate, because it may be exactly described but inaccurately gathered. (Maybe the surveyor made a mistake, or the data was recorded wrongly into the database).

##  Motivation of topological data models 

+ Topological errors

.center[
![:scale 65%](img/image10.jpg)
]

---
###  What is Topological Errors? 

+ Topological errors occur often during the digitizing process. Errors of the operator may result in polygon knots, and loops, and there may be some errors associated with damaged source maps as well.

###  Topological data models 

+ Data redundancy
.center[
![](img/image12.jpg)
]

---
###  Intelligence GIS Data Model: Topology 

+ It manages spatial relationships by representing spatial objects (point, line, and area features) as an underlying graph of topological primitives?nodes, faces, and edges.

###  Topological Data Models: ArcGIS Coverage 

+ A coverage is a georelational data model that stores vector data and their topology.

] 

---
###  Rule-based Topology 

+ Topology rules define the permissible spatial relationships between features.
	+ The rules you define for a topology control the relationships between features within a feature class, between features in different feature classes, or between subtypes of features.

###  Rule-based Topology: ArcGIS Geodatabase 

.pull-left[
+ The geodatabase is a collection of geographic datasets of various types used in ArcGIS and managed in either a file folder or a relational database.
	+ It is the native data source for ArcGIS and is used for editing and data automation in ArcGIS.

##  Issue of Multi-user editing: Transactions 

.pull-left[
.large[
+ A transaction is a group of changes that are made to a database as a coherent group.  All the changes that form part of a transaction are either committed or the database is rolled back to its initial state
	+ The solutions: pessimistic locking vs optimistic versioning

###  Spatial Indexing 

.pull-left[
.large[
+ Spatial indexes are used by spatial databases to optimise spatial queries.
	+ Indexes used by non-spatial databases cannot effectively handle features such as how far two points differ and whether points fall within a spatial area of interest.

###  About SpatiaLite ![](img/image20.jpg)

+ An open source library intended to extend the SQLite core to support fully fledged Spatial SQL capabilities.
	+ SQLite is intrinsically simple and lightweight:
		+ a single lightweight library implementing the full SQL engine
		+ standard SQL implementation: almost complete SQL-92
		+ no complex client/server architecture
		+ a whole database simply corresponds to a single monolithic file (no size limits)
		+ any DB-file can be safely exchanged across different platforms, because the internal architecture is universally portable
		+ no installation, no configuration
+ SpatiaLite is licensed under the MPL tri-license terms. you are free to choose the best-fit license between:
	+ the MPL 1.1
	+ the GPL v2.0 or any subsequent version
	+ the LGPL v2.1 or any subsequent version
	+ For more information

###  GeoPackage 

.large[
+ An open, non-proprietary, platform-independent and standards-based data format for geographic information system implemented as a SQLite database container.
+ To learn more about geopackage, visit [geopackage homepage](https://www.geopackage.org/) and at [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoPackage).

###  Getting to know GeoPackage 

.large[
+ Use open source SQLite as the storage engine, more reliable and platform independent than MDB, but with the advantage of easy, language independent, read/write access via SQL.
	+ The SQLite engine is open source and multi-platform, so no Windows dependency.
	+ The SQLite engine stores data in a single file, so no need to zip/unzip all the time .
	+ Leverage existing OGC standards like the WKT standard for spatial reference systems, and the WKB standard for binary geometry representation.
+ Document the format and include an extension mechanism so it can evolve over time and so third parties can experiment with new extensions.
+ To learn more, read [Getting Started With GeoPackage](http://www.geopackage.org/guidance/getting-started.html) 
]

---
###  Enterprise Geographic DBMS 

.large[
+ Provide spatial database management functions on top of conventional database management systems
	+ For example IBM DB2 Spatial Extender, Informix Spatial Datablade
]

![:scale 65%](img/image22.jpg)

---
###  Geographic Middleware Extensions 

.large[
+ Middle-tier application server that extend the DBMS software kernel to manage geographic data
	+ For example: Geomedia Transaction Server, SpatialWare from MapInfo, Enterprise Server from Manifold]

###  An example of metadata 

.pull-left[
.large[
+ Metadata is information about data. Similar to a library catalog record, metadata records document the who, what, when, where, how, and why of a data resource. 
+ Geospatial metadata describes maps, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) files, imagery, and other location-based data resources.

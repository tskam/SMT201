## What is Urban Planning?

--

### - A .brown[technical] and .brown[political process] concerned with the development and design of land use and the environment and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas.

--

### - The primary concern is the .brown[public welfare], which includes considerations of efficiency, sanitation, protection and use of the environment, as well as effects on social and economic activities.

--

### - Urban planning is considered an .brown[interdisciplinary] field that includes social engineering and design sciences.

## Urban Planning in Practice

--
### Practitioners of urban planning are concerned with research and analysis, strategic thinking, architecture, urban design, public consultation, policy recommendations, implementation and management.

--
### Enforcement methodologies include governmental zoning, planning permissions, and building codes, as well as private easements and restrictive covenants.

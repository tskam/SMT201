# 1.0	Introduction 

**Accessibility** is the measure of the capacity of a location to be reached from, or to be reached by, different locations. It is a key element in urban planning and management since it is a direct expression of mobility either in terms of people, freight, or information within a city or between cities.

Well-developed and efficient urban transport systems offer high accessibility levels, while less-developed ones have lower levels of accessibility. Thus, accessibility is linked with an array of economic and social opportunities.

All locations are not equal because some are more accessible than others, which implies **inequalities**.  Thus, accessibility is a proxy for **spatial inequalities**.

In this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on using both build in and plug-in network analysis functions of QGIS to derive accessibility indexes.  By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:

+ derive hexagon layer, 
+ extract, clean and process network data from roads layer of OSM data,
+ performing shortest path analysis using QGIS build in network analysis tools, and
+ performing network accessibility by using network analysis tools of QNEAT plug-in.

## Setting the scene

## 1.1	The Task

In this hands-on exercise, you are tasked to derive an accessibility to eldercare centre map of Singapore.

## 1.2	The Data

Three major data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise.  They are:

+ Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary from URA.  This data can be downloaded from data.gov.sg.
+ Eldercare services from Ministry of Social and Family Development.  This data can be downloaded from data.gov.sg. 
+ Roads data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data sets.  OSM data sets can be downloaded from Geofabrik's free download [server](https://download.geofabrik.de/). 

**Note:** I recommend this download site instead of [bbbike](https://www.bbbike.org/) because I found out that the quality of the data provided by Geofabrik is better than bbbike. 
  
# 2.0 Data Preparation

## 2.1 Start a new QGIS Project

>DIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, start a new QGIS project.  Save the project and give it a name (i.e. Hands-on_Ex10).  

**Reminder:** Ensure that svy21 projection system is used.

## 2.2 Preparing base layer for the study area

>DIY: Download Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary from data.gov.sg and import it into QGIS.  Then, save the GIS layer into GeoPackage format.  Name the output layer as `mpsz2014`.

## 2.2 Preparing eldercare layer

>DIY: Download eldercare services data from data.gov.sg and import it into QGIS (Ideally, the shapefile version should be used).  Then, save the GIS layer into GeoPackage format.  Name the output layer as `eldercare`.  

## 2.3 Extracting and preparing road network layer

### 2.3.1 Selecting all road network with the study area

>DIY: Using appropriate QGIS function(s) you had learned from previous hands-on exercise, clip the road network with Singapore mainland (excluding outer insland, Pulau Tekong and Pulau Ubi).  Save the GIS layer into GeoPackage format.  Call the layer `all_roads`.

### 2.3.2 Extracting motor vehicle road netowrk

>DIY: Using appropriate QGIS function(s) you had learned from previous hands-on Exercise, extract motor vechicle road network (i.e. motorway, motorway_link, primary, primary_link, secondary, secondary_link, tertiary, tertiary_link, residential, trunk and trunk_link) from the all_roads layer.  Save the GIS layer into GeoPackage format.  Name the layer `roads`.

**Be warn:** The original data is in **wgs84**.  For the purpose of network analysis, all network should be in projected coordinates system.

**Reminder:** Remove all the source data from QGIS project before continue to the next section.

# 3.0 Analytical Hexagon

In GIS analysis, regularly shaped grids is used for many reasons such as normalizing geography for mapping or to mitigate the issues of using irregularly shaped polygons created arbitrarily (such as county boundaries or block groups that have been created from a political process). Regularly shaped grids can only be comprised of equilateral triangles, squares, or hexagons, as these three polygon shapes are the only three that can tessellate (repeating the same shape over and over again, edge to edge, to cover an area without gaps or overlaps) to create an evenly spaced grid.

![](img/image1.png)

Though the square (fishnet) grid is the predominantly used shape type in GIS analysis and thematic mapping, there are ways in which hexagons may be better suited for your analysis based on the nature of your question.

Hexagons reduce sampling bias due to edge effects of the grid shape, this is related to the low perimeter-to-area ratio of the shape of the hexagon. A circle has the lowest ratio but cannot tessellate to form a continuous grid. Hexagons are the most circular-shaped polygon that can tessellate to form an evenly spaced grid.

## 3.1 Creating hexagon layer

Now, we are going to create a hexagon layer by using `mpsz` layer as the based.  The hexagon distance is 250m.

+ From the menu bar, select **Vector** -> **Research Tools** -> **Create Grids**.

**Create Grids** dialog window appears.

+ For **Grid type:** select *Hexagon (Polygon)* from the drop down list.

![](img/image1.jpg){width=35%}

+ For **Grid extend:**, select *Calculate from Layer* -> `mpsz`

![](img/image2.jpg){width=55%}

+ For **Horizontal spacing**, type *500*.
+ For **Vertical spacing**, type *500*.

>Question: Do you know why 500 is used?

+ For **Grid CRS**, make sure that *EPSG 3414* is used.

When you are ready to run the process,

+ Click on **Run** button.

**Reminder:** Read the Log before closing the dialog window.

+ Click on **Close** button.

Notice that a new temporary layer called `Grid` is added on the Layer pane and display on Map window.

### 3.1.2 Editing the hexagon layer

>DIY: Using appropriate QGIS functions, edit the temporary `Grid` layer until it looks similar to the screenshot below.

![](img/image4.jpg)

### 3.1.3 Saving the hexagon layer

>DIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, save the edited `Grid` layer into GeoPackage format.  Give the layer a name (i.e. `hexagon`)

Before you move on to the next section, remember to remove the temporary `Grid` layer.

## 3.2 Computing hexagon centroid

In general, network analysis required the demand in a point feature.  Hexagon, on the other hand, is a polygon feature.  In order to meet the analysis need, we will compute the centroids of the hexagons.   

+ From the menu bar, select **Vector** -> **Geometry Tools** -> **Centroids**.

**Centroids** dialog window appears.

+ For **Input layer**, select *hexagon* from the drop-down list.

When you are ready to run the process,

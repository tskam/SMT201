+ Attractively rendered tables with optional support for pagination.
+ Support for a wide variety of diagramming tools for illustrating concepts.
+ The ability to incorporate JavaScript and D3-based interactive visualizations.
+ A variety of ways to publish articles, including support for publishing sets of articles as a [Distill website](https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/) or as a [Distill blog](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/?_ga=2.77907540.1548782515.1631147933-1670780590.1620114500).]

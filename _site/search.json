You will also learn how to collecting, processing and analysing spatially related issues using real world data. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\r\nThe project is to be done in a team. You are required to form a project team of 2-3 members by the second week of the academic term. Each project team must start thinking about their project ideas after the first lesson. You are expected to discuss your project topic and scope of works with the instructor between week 2 to week 7 of the academic term. A project website must be prepared and uploaded to the course wiki page by the end of week 8.\r\nTopics\r\nThis year, there are two major project topics you can select from, they are: - Master Planning Change Detection and Evaluation - Business Trade Area Delineation and Profiling\r\nSeparate briefing will be conducted to provide you the detail of each of this project.\r\nScope of Work\r\nThe project will comprises of, but not limited to the followings steps: - Selection of project area, ideally a planning area such as Ang Mo Kio - Data collection - Designing and building GIS model and database - Performing GIS analysis - Preparing report of survey - Preparing poster and materials for townhall presentation\r\nPlease feel free to approach me for more details.\r\nProject Milestone\r\nFormulation of project team: by week 2 before lesson\r\nSelecting project area: by week 3 before lesson\r\nBrainstorming project objectives and scope of work: between week 4-7\r\nCreate project website : by week 8\r\nUpdate project webpage and interim project discussion with instructor: week 10\r\nSubmission of project poster: 13th November 2019, at 9.00am\r\nFinal project poster presentation: 18th November 2019 (Monday), at 11:00am-4:00pm\r\nSubmission of project artifacts and update project wiki: 24th November 2019 at 11.59pm (mid-night)\r\nGrading\r\nThe GIS project will count for 50% of your final grade in the course. The distribution of marks for each stage of the project are as follows: - Project proposal on wiki 5% - Project poster 5% - Poster presentation 10% - Final project report on wiki 15% - Project artifact 15%\r\nThe course instructor will consider strongly the novelty of the idea (If it has never been done before, you will get lots of credit!), how it addresses the problem at hand, the methodology you employ in doing the research, and your technical skill in implementing the idea.\r\nIn small group projects, each person will be graded individually. A good group project is a system consisting of a collection of well defined subsystems. Each subsystem should be the responsibility of one person and be clearly identified as their project. A good criteria for whether you should work in a group is whether the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\r\nTownhall Poster Presentation\r\nDate: 18th November 2019 (Monday)\r\nVenue: TBC\r\nTime: 11:00am - 4.00pm\r\nWe will organise a public presentation of the final projects. The presentation will be in the form of a poster session and live demo. You are required to bring a laptop with a working demo of your system. You should set up the laptop near your poster and use it to explain your project. During the presentation session, visitors and course instructor will view the various posters that are put up and pose questions to find out more details of the project. Be prepared to give a short 5-10 minute oral explanation and demo of what you did.\r\nDeliverables\r\nProject Proposal\r\nAs a first step, you should create a project wiki page (in the form of a wiki page) that includes the names of the members in your group, a title and a short (150-250 words) description of the GIS project, and a project proposal. The project proposal should include but not limited to the followings:\r\nMotivation of the project\r\nProject objective\r\nData\r\nScope of work\r\nProject schedule including a Gannt chart\r\nPoster\r\nThe poster should provide an overview of your project. It should include, but not limited to the following information: - Issues and problems - A clear statement of the issues or/and problems your project addresses. - Motivation - An explanation of why the issues and/or problems are interesting and what make them difficult to solve. - Approach - A description of the techniques or algorithms you used to solve the problem. - Results - Screenshots and a working demo of the system you built. - Future Work - An explanation of how the work could be extended.\r\nThe poster will be in ANSI A1 size (22\" × 34\" or 559mm × 864mm). It has to be in jpeg format. Please ensure that the poster is in high resolution (at least 300 dpi).\r\nThe poster will be considered a final deliverable, so don’t forget to apply good visual design principles to your poster as well as your project.\r\nNote: The course instructor will be responsible for printing your poster. You are required to upload your posters to the wiki page of your project one week and your project Dropbox before the poster presentation.\r\nBelow are sample posters for your reference: - Interactive Area Hotspot Detection A City’s Heartbeat BussStop Decrypting The Housing Prices In Singapore\r\nFinal Deliverable\r\nThe final deliverable will include:\r\nartifact, an implementation of your system (source code and executable) project report on wiki\r\nProject Report\r\nThe project report should focus on but not limited to the followings: - A detail discussion of the GIS analysis process and functions used. - A comprehensive discussion of the analysis results. - A collection of analytical maps (can be statics or interactive web maps)\r\nSubmission instruction\r\nYour final deliverable is due (submitted to LMS Dropbox) by the end of the day on 24th November 2019 at 11.59pm (mid-night).\r\nSample Projects\r\nNote that the following examples are for references purposes. You are urged to use your own creativity and innovation to design the application.\r\nAY2019-2020 Term 1 Project\r\nQ&A\r\nLink to Q&A/Project Discussion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

GIS with its capability to capture, manage, display, and analyse information spatially is emerging as one of the important enabling tool in smart city planning.\r\nThis course provides students with an introduction to practical applications of GIS in smart city management and planning. Emphasis will be placed on:\r\nlocating, acquiring and integrating multi-sources of data into GIS,\r\nunderstand the principles and methodologies of geocoding and geo referencing ,\r\nbecome familiar with geovisualisation and GIS analysis techniques, and\r\nexplore the technologies and possibilities of GIS-enabled Planning Support Systems for smart city management.\r\nObjectives\r\nUpon completion of the course, students will be able to:\r\nUnderstand the basic concepts and theories of GIScience and trends of GIS technologies.\r\nCreate, integrate, manage geospatial data and build enterprise level geospatial database management systems.\r\nUse appropriate GIS analysis functions to visualise and analyse urban sector data.\r\nModel smart city processes using GIS’ advanced analytical methods.\r\nDesign and implement cutting-edge GIS-based Planning Support Systems for smart city management.\r\nCourse structure\r\nBasic Modules\r\nThis course comprises ten integrated components as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-requisites\r\nThere are no pre-requisites for the class and the class is open to all SMT students as well as non-SMT students. However, a basic understanding of the principles of urban management and planning in the context of smart city is required. Students who are new to the discipline of urban management /planning and smart cities are encouraged to do self-learning and research prior to the commencement of the course.\r\nGrading Summary\r\nThe grading distribution of this course are as follows:\r\nComponent\r\nWeights\r\nClass Participation\r\n5%\r\nIn-class Exercises\r\n20%\r\nTake Home Exercises\r\n45%\r\nGIS Project\r\n30%\r\nThere will be no mid-term test or final examination for this course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

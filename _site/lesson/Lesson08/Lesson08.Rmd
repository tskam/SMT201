## GIS-based Prescriptive Model

.vlarge[
+ Suitability analysis in a GIS context is a geographic, or GIS-based process used to determine the appropriateness of a given area for a particular use. 

+ The basic premise of GIS suitability analysis is that each aspect of the landscape has intrinsic characteristics that are to some degree either suitable or unsuitable for the activities being planned. 

+ The results are often displayed on a map that is used to highlight areas from high to low suitability.

## Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP)

.pull-left[
.large[
+ A method for decision making in situations where multiple objectives are present. 
+ It uses a pair-wise comparison matrix to calculate the relative value and costs of security requirements. 
+ By using AHP, the requirements engineer can also confirm the consistency of the result. 
+ AHP can prevent subjective judgment errors and increase the likelihood that the results are reliable.

### AHP Steps

.large[
+ Review candidate requirements for completeness.

+ Apply the pair-wise comparison method to assess the relative value of the candidate requirements.

+ Apply the pair-wise comparison method to assess the relative cost of implementing each candidate requirement.

+ Calculate each candidate requirement's relative value and implementation cost, and plot each on a cost-value diagram.

+ Use the cost-value diagram as a map for analyzing the candidate requirements.

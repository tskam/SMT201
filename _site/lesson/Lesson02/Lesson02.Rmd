### Limitation of shapefile

.vlarge[
- It is proprietary (closed and controlled by ESRI).
- It‚Äôs a multifile format (.shp,.dbf.,.shx,.prj, encoding, other indexes, etc.) (everybody knows the problem with GIS newbies sending you solely the .shp‚Ä¶ üòâ).
- Attribute names are limited to 10 characters and only 255 attributes are allowed in .dbf.
- Limited data types. Data types are limited to float, integer, date and text with a maximum 254 characters. 
- Unknown character set. There is no way to specify the character set used in the database.
- It's limited to 2GB of file size. Although some tools are able to surpass this limit, they can never exceed 4GB of data.
]

---
### Limitation of shapefile

.vlarge[
- Uses ESRI‚Äôs [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). Can result in inconsistencies.
- Single geometry type per file. There is no way to save mixed geometry features.
- More complicated data structures are impossible to save. It's a "flat table" format.
- There is no way to store 3D data with textures or appearances such as material definitions. There is also no way to store solids or parametric objects.
- Projections definition. They are incompatible or missing.
- Line and polygon geometry type, single or multipart, cannot be reliably determined at the layer level, it must be determined at the individual feature level.

.center[

???
A raster can contain one or more bands. One type of multi-band raster dataset that is familiar to many of us is a color image. A basic color image consists of three bands: red, green, and blue. Each band represents light reflected from the red, green or blue portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The pixel brightness for each band, when composited creates the colors that we see in an image.

## Coordinate Systems and Map Projections
### What is a coordinate system?

.center[
![:scale 55%](img/image2-17.jpg)
]

???
A coordinate system is an important property of an geospatial data.  It provides a location reference to the geospatial data.  

- A coordinate system is a reference system used to represent the locations of geographic features, imagery, and observations such as GPS locations within a common geographic framework.

- Each coordinate system is defined by:
    - Its measurement framework which is either geographic (in which spherical coordinates are measured from the earth's center) or planimetric (in which the earth's coordinates are projected onto a two-dimensional planar surface).
    - Unit of measurement (typically feet or meters for projected coordinate systems or decimal degrees for latitude‚Äìlongitude).
    - The definition of the map projection for projected coordinate systems.
    - Other measurement system properties such as a spheroid of reference, a datum, and projection parameters like one or more standard parallels, a central meridian, and possible shifts in the x- and y-directions.
    
- There are two common types of coordinate systems used in mapping, namely: **geographic coordinate systems** and **projected coordinate system**.

---
### Geographical Coordinate Systems

.center[
![](img/image2-18.jpg)]

.small[Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection]

???
GCS define locations on the earth using a three-dimensional spherical surface. For example, WGS84

They provides accuracy position information. Unit of measurement will be in either decimal degree or degree-minute-second format.

GCS, however, are not appropriate for distance and area measurements.  In this figure, it is clear that 1 degree distance at the north pole is relatively shorter than 1 degree at the equator.


---
### Projected Coordinate Systems

.large[
- Based on a map projection such as transverse Mercator, Albers equal area, or Robinson.
]

.center[
![:scale 85%](img/image2-19.jpg)]

???
A **projected coordinate system** based on a map projection such as transverse Mercator, Albers equal area, or Robinson, all of which (along with numerous other map projection models) provide various mechanisms to project maps of the earth's spherical surface onto a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate plane. 

Projected coordinate systems are sometimes referred to as **map projections**. For example, SVY21, the national projected coordinate system of Singapore.

PCS provides consistent length and area measurement across space.  Hence, it is important to transform a geospatial data from GCS to PCS before performing geospatial analysis.

### Singapore Projected Coordinate System

.center[

.large[
- [epsg.io](https://epsg.io/) provides a comprehensive list of country coordinate systems such as [svy21](https://epsg.io/3414).
]

???
Each country will have her own projected coordinate system.  Some country have more than one type of Project Coordinate Systems.

There are at least three coordinate systems commonly used in Singapore.  They are svy21, Kertau Cassini 1968, and Rectified Skewed Orthomorphic (RSO).  RSO is used in military and topographical mapping and svy21 is used for land and engineering surveying, cadastre, landuse and infrastructure mapping.

### EPSG Reference System 

.large[

![](img/image2-21.jpg)
]

???
The EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset is a structured dataset of Coordinate Reference Systems and Coordinate Transformations. In 2005, OGP absorbed the European Petroleum Survey Group or EPSG, (1986‚Äì2005) into its structure. 

EPSG was a scientific organization with ties to the European petroleum industry consisting of specialists working in applied geodesy, surveying, and cartography related to oil exploration. EPSG compiled and disseminated the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Set, a widely used database of Earth ellipsoids, geodetic datums, geographic and projected coordinate systems, units of measurement, etc.

### What is geocoding 

- Reference data: features with address attributes
Points, lines, polygons.

.center[
![:scale 85%](img/image2-22.jpg)

.small[Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding 
]]

???
Geocoding styles
When geocoding an address, a geocoding service searches through the features in the reference data feature class to find the feature with address attributes that most closely match the address. The geometry of the matching feature is then used to create geometry for the address. Geocoding services can further use other types of reference data, such as alternate street name tables and place name alias tables. Some of the styles available are:
 Single field geocoding service style
 US One Address geocoding service style
 US One Range geocoding service style
 US Streets geocoding service style
 ZIP geocoding service style
 ZIP+4 geocoding service style
 ZIP+4 Range geocoding service style
 US Alphanumeric Ranges geocoding service style
 US Hyphenated Ranges geocoding service style
 US Cities with State geocoding service style
 World Cities with Country geocoding service style

It encodes a geographic location into a short string of letters and digits. 
It is a hierarchical spatial data structure which subdivides space into buckets of grid shape, which is one of the many applications of what is known as a Z-order curve, and generally space-filling curves. (http://geohash.gofreerange.com/)

### Structure of SLA‚Äôs Address-Point data

.center[
![:scale 75%](img/image2-25.jpg)
]

???
It is important to note that the 6-digit postal code used in Address-point data is in character data type and not numerical data type.  This is because at downtown area such as Outram Plannign subzone, the postal codes start with 0, as a result, if numeric data type is used.  These postal codes will truncated into five digits.

### Geography Markup Language (GML)

.large[
+ GML is the XML grammar defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to express geographical features.  
+ It serves as a modeling language for geographic systems as well as an open interchange format for geographic transactions on the Internet.]

### ArcGIS Server (ESRI)

.pull-left[
.large[
+ A back-end server software component of ArcGIS Enterprise that makes your geographic information available to others in your organization and, optionally, anyone with an internet connection. 
+ This is accomplished through GIS services, which allow a server computer to receive and process requests for information sent by other devices.

### GeoServer

.pull-left[
.large[
+ Java-based software server that allows users to view and edit geospatial data. 
+ Designed for interoperability, it publishes data from any major spatial data source using open standards. 
+ Use free and open source software
+ Integrate with existing mapping APIs such as Google Map, Yahoo Map, and Microsoft Bing Map.

### Leaflet: JavaScript GeoWeb Mapping APIs

.pull-left[
.large[
+ An open-source (BSD license) JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. (https://leafletjs.com/) 
+ It helps you bring geospatial data to life using HTML5, SVG and CSS, no plugin is required.
+ It can be used with almost any online map including proprietary tile servers.
+ Weighing just about 31 KB of JS, it has all the features most developers ever need for online maps including mobile.
+ To learn more and download, click on this [link](https://leafletjs.com/).

### qgis2web plug-in

.pull-left[
.large[
+ qgis2web generates a web map from your current QGIS project, either as OpenLayers, Leaflet, or Mapbox GL JS. 
+ It replicates as many aspects of the project as it can, including layers, styles (including categorized and graduated), and extent. 
+ No server-side software required.

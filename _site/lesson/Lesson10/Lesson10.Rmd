# A Network Model

.large[
+ A **link** refers to a linear segment defined by two end points.  Also called **edges**.
+ A **node** refers to an end point of a link.

## Two types of networks 

.pull-left[
.large[
+ Geometric 
  + Directed flow, away from sources and toward sinks
  + Resources make no travel decisions

+ Topologic
  + Undirected flow
  + Resources make their own travel decisions

## A Transportation Network

.large[
This network theme represents city streets and highways. Several theme attributes, such as speed limits, the number of lanes a street has, or which streets are one-way or two-way, can affect the flow of goods and services through a network.

## An Utility Network

.large[
Utilities can also be network themes. In this example, the diameter of the waterlines, the system's water pressure, and the location of control valves can affect the flow of the water through the network.]

## A River Network

.large[
River systems can be represented as a network or a series of networks. Some systems may not connect while other systems may connect naturally or may be connected by canals. The location of locks, river width, river depth, and current can affect the analysis.

### Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm

.pull-left[
.large[
+ Nodes adjacent to the origin node are in red.]]

### Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm

.pull-left[
.large[
+ Because the line between nodes a and b has the lowest cost (8), node b becomes a reached node. ]]

### Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm

.pull-left[
.large[

### Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm

.pull-left[
.large[
+ The least cost path now travels from node a to node b to node f.]]

.pull-right[

---
### Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm

.pull-left[
.large[
+ The cost of going from node a to node c to node e is 15, while the cost of going from node a to node d to node e is 16. The algorithm will choose the former, least cost, path.]]
